# House Price Prediction – King County, USA

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict house prices using the King County housing dataset. The analysis includes data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and regression modeling.

This project was completed as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Course sponsored by MTN Skills Academy (Coursera).

## Project Objectives

Clean and preprocess housing data

Handle missing values (Kc_house_data_NaN)

Perform exploratory data analysis

Apply regression models for price prediction

Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics

## Dataset

Source: King County House Sales Dataset

Modified version used: Kc_house_data_NaN.csv

## How to Run

From project root:

Run model:
```python src/house_price_model.py```

Run tests:
```python -m unittest discover test```

## Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

## Machine Learning Approach

Data preprocessing

Feature scaling

Linear Regression

Model evaluation (R², MSE)

## Key Outcomes

Built a regression model for house price prediction

Improved understanding of feature impact on property valuation

Applied end-to-end ML workflow from raw data to model evaluation
